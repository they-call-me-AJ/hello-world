# hello-world
My name is AJ.  I'm pretty new to programming.  I took a C++ class in college and had a few upper division engineering classes that utilized MatLab for solving differential equations, but that was many moons ago.  

I'm now trying to learn R and Python to learn the ropes of data science.  I'm particularly interested in machine learning.
